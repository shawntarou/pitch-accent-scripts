## Description
2 scripts that allow me to edit the Japanese pitch accent graphs on Anki cards generated from [Yomitan](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan) + pitch accent dictionaries.
These scripts only works for Windows at the moment.

## How to use:
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open pitch accent graph in Anki by navigating to a card and clicking the dropdown arrow or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
5. Copy graph svg text into clipboard.
6. Run either remove-duplicates.py or pitch-selector.py.
7. Paste result back into Anki Card.
8. Profit!
